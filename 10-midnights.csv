midnights,Maroon,2,When the morning came,1
midnights,Maroon,2,We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf,2
midnights,Maroon,2,'Cause we lost track of time again,3
midnights,Maroon,2,Laughing with my feet in your lap,4

midnights,Maroon,2,And how the blood rushed into my cheeks,15
midnights,Maroon,2,"So scarlet, it was",16
midnights,Maroon,2,The mark they saw on my collarbone,17
